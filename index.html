    <p><span class="first-character sc">J</span>dm Style started in japan, specifically Osaka. The JDM car scene got really big in the 90's. The favourite amoung most JDM car enthusiasts is the Honda civic. The civic is so popular because its very easy to modify.
Honda motor.co developed many motors but amoung the most popular was the b-series.The B-series are a family of inline four-cylinder DOHC automotive engines introduced by Honda in 1989. the B-series were aimed more as a performance option, featuring dual-overhead cams along with the first application of Honda's VTEC system available in some models.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character ny">W</span>ell, it finally came! New year, a fresh start for us all, even if we are not in the clear just yet. But I bet most of you are relieved to at least start affresh. As vaccinations ramp up and what we considered normal resumes slowly; but surely, I hope events, shows, and travel can pick off where we left in 2019. 
    While most were aiming to start their Sunday mornings by waking up early for the first ‘SMD’ of 2021, I decided to go the other way; i.e sleeping in until 8 AM, and taking my time to drive over to Ocean Terminal in Tsim Tsa Tsui to treat myself to my first slap-up brunch of the year. Ideally a deli sandwich with fries, paired with an iced coffee and milkshake. </p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Secretly though, I was hoping to catch some kind of car action that morning; at least to kill some time until restaurants opened up a few hours later. The Ocean Terminal Car Park, especially on the upper level, tends to be a regular meeting spot for car clubs on early weekend mornings. A couple of my Morning Drive acquaintances have hit gold previously, usually from a tip off or simply stopping by the car park Sunday mornings. They’ve been lucky to check out a NSX club meeting, the Hong Kong Supra Club, to name a few. All usually when I decided to sleep in on Sunday and get some rest. But deep down, considering these meets are mainly invite-only; kept to a select few (to keep the traffic police at bay or wannabe street racers from calling it off as soon as it begins), I was banking on something happening that day. 
    And if it turned out there was nothing that morning, it wouldn’t be a lost cause for me: considering I would have snagged early-bird parking at a shopping center that is always packed Sundays, I could get some photos of the A Class  and my Christmas haul (stickers/merch) at one of the best spots in the city, and get a guaranteed table at my stop for brunch. 
    But it seems luck was on my side that day. As soon as I pulled up to the top floor, some recognizable shapes could be made out as I had a look around. A few Honda coupes, NSXs, and some Supras. </p>
